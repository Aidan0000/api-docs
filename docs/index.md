# Introduction

This is a community initiative by members of the last.fm Discord to create better documentation for the last.fm API. Anyone is welcome to join and help create better documentation.

## What makes this better then the official documentation?

There are multiple reasons we're doing this:

- The official docs often have outdated examples, and they're all in XML
- Examples with parameters and showing what objects to expect are easier to work with
- The API often has weird behaviour that we feel should be documented so developers don't have to figure that out themselves
- Error responses are often inconsistent and don't match the docs. It would save developers time if they are well documented
- Documentation should be open source so anyone can fix errors if they find them

## Sounds great! How can I contribute?

You can check out the docs [here](https://github.com/lastfm-docs/api-docs/tree/master/docs). 

It's all in markdown, so easy to work with. Please follow the other pages in styling and objects.

We use MkDocs with some extensions for extra markdown types. Some of the extensions are: [Tabbed](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/tabbed/) and [Details (collapsible objects)](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/)
