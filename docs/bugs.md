# Bugs

The last.fm API is by no means updated or maintained regularly, due to this, responses are often riddled with inconsistency and is not up to standards. This page aims to document these bugs, and similar instances of malformed responses and be a reference for developers trying to make last.fm apps and tools.

Every part of this page documents a different case and can be linked to individually to help make helping newcomers feasible.
